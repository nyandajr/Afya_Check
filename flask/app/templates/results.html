            Substance Alcohol Use Disorder, also known as alcohol addiction, is a chronic and progressive condition
            characterized by the excessive and compulsive use of alcohol despite the negative consequences. Early signs
            of this
            problem include drinking more than intended, experiencing cravings or withdrawal symptoms when not drinking,
            neglecting responsibilities, and continuing to drink despite social or legal problems.
